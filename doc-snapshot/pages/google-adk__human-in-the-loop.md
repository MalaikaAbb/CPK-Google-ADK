# HITL Overview

> Allow your agent and users to collaborate on complex tasks.


<!-- interactive demo: hitl-in-chat -->


## What is this?

Human-in-the-loop (HITL) lets an agent pause mid-run to collect input,
confirmation, or a choice from the user, then resume with that answer
folded back into its reasoning. It's what turns an autonomous workflow
into a collaborative one: the agent keeps its context, the user keeps
the steering wheel.

## When should I use this?

Use HITL when you need:

- **Quality control** — a human gate at high-stakes decision points
- **Edge cases** — graceful fallbacks when the agent's confidence is low
- **Expert input** — lean on the user for domain knowledge the model lacks
- **Reliability** — a more robust loop for real-world, production traffic

## Two patterns for HITL in CopilotKit

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Install the ADK + AG-UI bridge

    ```bash
    pip install ag-ui-adk
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Add `AGUIToolset()` to your agent

    Tool-based HITL (`useHumanInTheLoop`) registers the picker UI on the
    frontend; CopilotKit forwards the tool definition to your model through
    `AGUIToolset()`. ADK doesn't have a native `interrupt(...)` primitive
    like LangGraph — for graph-paused pauses, use the frontend
    Promise-based `useFrontendTool` pattern instead.

    
~~~~python title="hitl_in_chat_agent.py"
from google.adk.agents import LlmAgent
from ag_ui_adk import AGUIToolset

from agents.shared_chat import get_model, stop_on_terminal_text

# CopilotKit wires into ADK via the `AGUIToolset()` tool: pass it in the
# `tools=` list of your `LlmAgent` to expose CopilotKit's frontend-tool
# channel to the model. `stop_on_terminal_text` is a small ADK callback
# that lets CopilotKit's UI know when the agent has finished its turn.
_INSTRUCTION = (
    "You are a planning assistant. When the user asks you to plan something, "
    "always call generate_task_steps with the proposed list of steps (each "
    "with description + status='enabled'). The frontend will render the "
    "steps inline and the user will confirm or reject — your job is to plan "
    "and call the tool, then summarise the user's decision once they "
    "respond."
)

hitl_in_chat_agent = LlmAgent(
    name="HitlInChatAgent",
    model=get_model(),
    instruction=_INSTRUCTION,
    tools=[AGUIToolset()],
    after_model_callback=stop_on_terminal_text,
)

  </Step>
</Steps>

CopilotKit ships two complementary ways to pause an agent turn and ask
the human something. They look similar from the outside (the chat
pauses, a custom component appears, the user answers, the run resumes)
but they're wired differently on the backend, and each has its own niche.

| Pattern | Who decides to pause? | Backend surface |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `useHumanInTheLoop` | The **LLM**, by calling a registered client-side tool | A frontend-only tool description (Zod schema + `render`) |
| `useInterrupt` | The **graph**, by calling `interrupt(...)` during a node | A server-side `interrupt()` call in your LangGraph agent |

**Pick `useHumanInTheLoop`** when the pause is an _agent-initiated_
decision — the model chose to ask the user — and you want the picker UI
inlined into the normal tool-call flow.

**Pick `useInterrupt`** when the pause is a _graph-enforced_ checkpoint —
the code path deterministically requires a human answer — and you want
`langgraph.interrupt()` as the server-side contract.

## Pattern 1 — `useHumanInTheLoop` (tool-based)

The agent registers a HITL tool on the client with `useHumanInTheLoop`.
When the LLM calls that tool, CopilotKit routes the call through your
`render` function, which shows a custom component and calls `respond`
with the user's answer. The agent sees the answer as the tool result and
continues from there.

```typescript
// src/app/demos/hitl-in-chat/page.tsx
import React from "react";
import {
  CopilotKit,
  CopilotChat,
  useHumanInTheLoop,
  useConfigureSuggestions,
} from "@copilotkit/react-core/v2";
import { z } from "zod";
import { TimePickerCard, TimeSlot } from "./time-picker-card";

const DEFAULT_SLOTS: TimeSlot[] = [
  { label: "Tomorrow 10:00 AM", iso: "2026-04-19T10:00:00-07:00" },
  { label: "Tomorrow 2:00 PM", iso: "2026-04-19T14:00:00-07:00" },
  { label: "Monday 9:00 AM", iso: "2026-04-21T09:00:00-07:00" },
  { label: "Monday 3:30 PM", iso: "2026-04-21T15:30:00-07:00" },
];

export default function HitlInChatDemo() {
  return (
    <CopilotKit runtimeUrl="/api/copilotkit" agent="hitl-in-chat">
      <div className="flex justify-center items-center h-screen w-full">
        <div className="h-full w-full max-w-4xl">
          <Chat />
        </div>
      </div>
    </CopilotKit>
  );
}

function Chat() {
  useConfigureSuggestions({
    suggestions: [
      {
        title: "Book a call with sales",
        message:
          "Please book an intro call with the sales team to discuss pricing.",
      },
      {
        title: "Schedule a 1:1 with Alice",
        message: "Schedule a 1:1 with Alice next week to review Q2 goals.",
      },
    ],
    available: "always",
  });

  useHumanInTheLoop({
    agentId: "hitl-in-chat",
    name: "book_call",
    description:
      "Ask the user to pick a time slot for a call. The picker UI presents fixed candidate slots; the user's choice is returned to the agent.",
    parameters: z.object({
      topic: z
        .string()
        .describe("What the call is about (e.g. 'Intro with sales')"),
      attendee: z
        .string()
        .describe("Who the call is with (e.g. 'Alice from Sales')"),
    }),
    render: ({ args, status, respond }: any) => (
      <TimePickerCard
        topic={args?.topic ?? "a call"}
        attendee={args?.attendee}
        slots={DEFAULT_SLOTS}
        status={status}
        onSubmit={(result) => respond?.(result)}
      />
    ),
  });
```

The picker UI is fed a static list of candidate slots — this is just
data the demo page owns, so you can swap in real availability, a
calendar API, or anything else:

```typescript
// src/app/demos/hitl-in-chat/page.tsx
import React from "react";
import {
  CopilotKit,
  CopilotChat,
  useHumanInTheLoop,
  useConfigureSuggestions,
} from "@copilotkit/react-core/v2";
import { z } from "zod";
import { TimePickerCard, TimeSlot } from "./time-picker-card";

const DEFAULT_SLOTS: TimeSlot[] = [
  { label: "Tomorrow 10:00 AM", iso: "2026-04-19T10:00:00-07:00" },
  { label: "Tomorrow 2:00 PM", iso: "2026-04-19T14:00:00-07:00" },
  { label: "Monday 9:00 AM", iso: "2026-04-21T09:00:00-07:00" },
  { label: "Monday 3:30 PM", iso: "2026-04-21T15:30:00-07:00" },
];
```

## Pattern 2 — `useInterrupt` (graph-paused)

With LangGraph's `interrupt()` the pause is enforced by the graph
itself: a node calls `interrupt({...})`, the run suspends, the client
receives the payload, renders a UI, and resumes the run with the user's
answer. CopilotKit's `useInterrupt` hook is the render contract.

See the [`useInterrupt` deep dive](/google-adk/human-in-the-loop/useInterrupt) for
the full walkthrough, including the backend tool and render-prop wiring.

## Going headless

Both patterns above ship with a `render` prop — CopilotKit handles the
"when to show the picker" logic for you. If you want to drive
interrupt resolution from a custom UI that lives anywhere in the tree
(not necessarily inside a chat), see the
[headless interrupts guide](/google-adk/human-in-the-loop/headless) — it shows
how to compose `useAgent`, `agent.subscribe`, and `copilotkit.runAgent`
to build your own `useInterrupt` equivalent.
