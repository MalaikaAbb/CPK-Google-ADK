# Shared State

> Create a two-way connection between your UI and agent state.


## What is shared state?

Agentic Copilots maintain a shared state that seamlessly connects your UI with the agent's execution. This shared state system allows you to:

- Display the agent's current progress and intermediate results
- Update the agent's state through UI interactions
- React to state changes in real-time across your application

## When should I use this?

Use shared state when you want the agent and the user to collaborate through the
same application state. The agent's outputs are reflected in the UI, and user
updates in the UI are reflected in the agent's execution.

## Reading agent state

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Install the ADK + AG-UI bridge

    ```bash
    pip install ag-ui-adk
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Add `AGUIToolset()` to your agent

    Shared state in ADK lives in `tool_context.state` — your tools write to
    it directly and the runtime forwards updates to the UI. Wire your
    `LlmAgent` with `AGUIToolset()` and CopilotKit takes care of the rest.

    
~~~~python title="shared_state_read_write_agent.py"
shared_state_read_write_agent = LlmAgent(
    name="SharedStateReadWriteAgent",
    model=get_model(),
    instruction=_INSTRUCTION,
    tools=[set_notes, AGUIToolset()],
    before_model_callback=_inject_preferences,
    after_model_callback=stop_on_terminal_text,
)
~~~~


    See `src/agents/shared_state_read_write_agent.py` for the bidirectional
    pattern: a before-model callback reads UI-authored preferences out of
    session state, and a `set_notes` tool writes agent-authored notes back.

  </Step>
</Steps>

Subscribe a component to the agent's state with `useAgent`. Any time the agent
mutates its state, for example via a tool call, the hook fires and your UI
re-renders with the new values.

```typescript
// src/app/demos/shared-state-read-write/page.tsx
  // Subscribe the component to agent state changes. Any time the agent
  // mutates its state (e.g. via its `set_notes` tool) this hook fires,
  // we re-render, and the sidebar panels reflect the new values.
  const { agent } = useAgent({
    agentId: "shared-state-read-write",
    updates: [UseAgentUpdate.OnStateChanged],
  });
```

The returned `agent.state` is just a plain object. Read it like any other
piece of React state and render the parts you care about: agent-written
notes, structured outputs, progress indicators, anything the agent has put
there.

## Writing agent state

The same `agent` object exposes a `setState` setter. Calling it from a UI
event handler pushes the new value into shared state, and the agent reads it
back on its next turn. The UI's writes visibly steer the model.

```typescript
// src/app/demos/shared-state-read-write/page.tsx
  // WRITE: every edit in the sidebar goes straight into agent state.
  // On the agent's next turn, `_inject_preferences` reads this back out
  // of state and prepends a preferences SystemMessage — so the UI's
  // writes visibly steer the model.
  const handlePreferencesChange = (next: Preferences) => {
    agent.setState({
      ...(agentState as object | undefined),
      preferences: next,
      notes: agentState?.notes ?? [],
    } as RWAgentState);
  };
```

This is what makes the channel two-way: the UI doesn't just observe the
agent, it can hand the agent fresh inputs (preferences, selections, partial
work) without going through the chat thread.

## Rendering shared state in the UI

Because `agent.state` is plain React data, the UI layer is whatever you'd
normally build. The demo on this page wires the agent's outputs into a
small card component and feeds user edits back through `setState`.

```typescript
// src/app/demos/shared-state-read-write/notes-card.tsx
// Read-side render: this card reflects the agent-authored `notes` slice
// of shared state. The parent page passes `state.notes` in; we never
// touch agent state ourselves — we just render it. The Clear button is
// a small write-back, exposed as an `onClear` prop.
export function NotesCard({ notes, onClear }: NotesCardProps) {
  return (
    <Card data-testid="notes-card" className="w-full">
      <CardHeader>
        <div className="flex items-start justify-between gap-3">
          <div className="space-y-1.5">
            <CardTitle>Agent Scratch pad</CardTitle>
            <CardDescription>
              The agent writes here via its{" "}
              <code className="font-mono text-[11px] text-[#010507]">
                set_notes
              </code>{" "}
              tool. The UI re-renders from shared state.
            </CardDescription>
          </div>
          {notes.length > 0 && (
            <Button
              type="button"
              onClick={onClear}
              data-testid="notes-clear-button"
              variant="destructive"
              size="sm"
              className="uppercase tracking-[0.14em] text-[10px]"
            >
              Clear
            </Button>
          )}
        </div>
      </CardHeader>

      <CardContent>
        {notes.length === 0 ? (
          <div
            data-testid="notes-empty"
            className="text-sm text-[#838389] italic min-h-[160px] flex items-center justify-center text-center px-4 border border-dashed border-[#E9E9EF] rounded-xl bg-[#FAFAFC]"
          >
            the agent will make observations about you and note them here!
          </div>
        ) : (
          <ul
            data-testid="notes-list"
            className="space-y-2 text-sm text-[#010507]"
          >
            {notes.map((note, i) => (
              <li
                key={i}
                data-testid="note-item"
                className="flex gap-2 rounded-lg border border-[#E9E9EF] bg-[#FAFAFC] px-3 py-2"
              >
                <span className="text-[#838389] font-mono text-xs leading-5 select-none">
                  {String(i + 1).padStart(2, "0")}
                </span>
                <span className="flex-1">{note}</span>
              </li>
            ))}
          </ul>
        )}
      </CardContent>
    </Card>
  );
}
```

Nothing about this is chat-specific: `useAgent` works in any component under
`<CopilotKit>`, so you can render `agent.state` in your main view or canvas,
not just inside the chat panel. See
**[Render agent state in your app](/google-adk/shared-state/rendering-in-app)** for the
full main-view pattern.

## Streaming partial state updates

By default, agent state only updates *between* backend checkpoints, so a
long-running tool call appears as one big burst at the end. State streaming
forwards a specific tool argument straight into a state key *as it's being
generated*, so the UI can watch the answer assemble token-by-token.

```python
# src/agents/shared_state_streaming_agent.py
from __future__ import annotations

from ag_ui_adk import AGUIToolset
from ag_ui_adk.config import PredictStateMapping
from google.adk.agents import LlmAgent
from google.adk.tools import ToolContext

from agents.shared_chat import get_model, stop_on_terminal_text


def write_document(tool_context: ToolContext, document: str) -> dict:
    """Write a document into shared state.

    Whenever the user asks you to write or draft anything (essay, poem,
    email, summary, etc.), call this tool with the full content as a
    single string. The UI renders state["document"] live as you type.

    Argument name `document` mirrors langgraph-python's `write_document`
    signature so the shared D5 fixture (`tool_argument="document"`) and
    the LGP-aligned PredictStateMapping below stay in lock-step.
    """
    tool_context.state["document"] = document
    return {"status": "ok", "length": len(document)}


_INSTRUCTION = (
    "You are a collaborative writing assistant. Whenever the user asks "
    "you to write, draft, or revise any piece of text, ALWAYS call the "
    "`write_document` tool with the full content as a single string. "
    "Never paste the document into a chat message directly — the document "
    "belongs in shared state and the UI renders it live as you type."
)

shared_state_streaming_agent = LlmAgent(
    name="SharedStateStreamingAgent",
    model=get_model(),
    instruction=_INSTRUCTION,
    tools=[write_document, AGUIToolset()],
    after_model_callback=stop_on_terminal_text,
)


SHARED_STATE_STREAMING_PREDICT_STATE = [
    PredictStateMapping(
        state_key="document",
        tool="write_document",
        tool_argument="document",
        emit_confirm_tool=False,
        stream_tool_call=True,
    ),
]
```

See **[State streaming](/google-adk/shared-state/streaming)** for the full walkthrough,
including the corresponding `useAgent` subscription on the frontend.

## Read-only context

When the value is **UI-owned** and the agent should read it but never write
it back, such as current user, selected record, or scroll position, reach for
`useAgentContext` instead of full shared state. It publishes values as a
one-way UI-to-agent channel that auto-unregisters on unmount.

See **[Agent read-only context](/google-adk/shared-state/agent-readonly)** for the
full pattern.
