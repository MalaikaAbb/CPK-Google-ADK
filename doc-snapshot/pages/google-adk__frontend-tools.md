# Frontend Tools

> Let your agent interact with and update your application's UI.



<!-- interactive demo: frontend-tools -->


<Callout type="info" title="See this in Inspector">
  Open Inspector on localhost. Go to **Agents**, then **Frontend Tools**.
  Your tool and its schema are listed.

<Callout type="info" title="See this in Inspector">
  Open Inspector on localhost. Go to **Inspect**, then **Event Snippets**.
  You can compile a tool call, reasoning, text, or activity, run it on the live
  agent, and save it. Saved snippets are grouped by recipe. On localhost chat,
  **Save as snippet** uses the recipe for the thing you click and fills the form.
  On a tool call, generative UI, or A2UI, the bookmark sits to the right of the
  block (or to the left if there is no room on the right).
  Run of a `generateSandboxedUi` tool call paints the sandbox UI in chat.

## What is this?

Frontend tools let your agent define and invoke client-side functions that run entirely in the user's browser. Because the handler executes on the frontend, it has direct access to component state, browser APIs, and any third-party UI library the page already uses. That's how an agent can "reach into" the app: update React state, trigger animations, read `localStorage`, pop a toast, or steer the user's view.

This page covers the "agent drives the UI" shape of frontend tools. The same primitive also powers Generative UI and Human-in-the-loop; see those pages for interaction patterns.

## When should I use this?

Use frontend tools when your agent needs to:

- Read or modify React component state
- Access browser APIs like `localStorage`, `sessionStorage`, or cookies
- Trigger UI updates, animations, or transitions
- Show alerts, toasts, or notifications
- Interact with third-party frontend libraries
- Perform anything that requires the user's immediate browser context

## How it works in code

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Install the ADK + AG-UI bridge

    ```bash
    pip install ag-ui-adk
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Add `AGUIToolset()` to your agent

    `AGUIToolset()` is the tool that exposes CopilotKit's frontend-tool
    channel to the model — drop it into your `LlmAgent`'s `tools=` list and
    frontend tools become available on every turn. Pair it with
    `stop_on_terminal_text` as the `after_model_callback` so CopilotKit's UI
    knows when the agent has finished its turn.

    
~~~~python title="hitl_in_chat_agent.py"
from google.adk.agents import LlmAgent
from ag_ui_adk import AGUIToolset

from agents.shared_chat import get_model, stop_on_terminal_text

# CopilotKit wires into ADK via the `AGUIToolset()` tool: pass it in the
# `tools=` list of your `LlmAgent` to expose CopilotKit's frontend-tool
# channel to the model. `stop_on_terminal_text` is a small ADK callback
# that lets CopilotKit's UI know when the agent has finished its turn.
_INSTRUCTION = (
    "You are a planning assistant. When the user asks you to plan something, "
    "always call generate_task_steps with the proposed list of steps (each "
    "with description + status='enabled'). The frontend will render the "
    "steps inline and the user will confirm or reject — your job is to plan "
    "and call the tool, then summarise the user's decision once they "
    "respond."
)

hitl_in_chat_agent = LlmAgent(
    name="HitlInChatAgent",
    model=get_model(),
    instruction=_INSTRUCTION,
    tools=[AGUIToolset()],
    after_model_callback=stop_on_terminal_text,
)

  </Step>
</Steps>

Register a frontend tool with `useFrontendTool`. Give it a name, a Zod schema for parameters, and a handler. The agent can then call it like any other tool and your frontend runs it in the browser.

```typescript
// src/app/demos/frontend-tools/page.tsx
import React, { useState } from "react";
import {
  CopilotKit,
  CopilotSidebar,
  useFrontendTool,
} from "@copilotkit/react-core/v2";
import { z } from "zod";
import { Background, DEFAULT_BACKGROUND } from "./background";
import { useFrontendToolsSuggestions } from "./suggestions";

export default function FrontendToolsDemo() {
  return (
    <CopilotKit runtimeUrl="/api/copilotkit" agent="frontend_tools">
      <Chat />
    </CopilotKit>
  );
}

function Chat() {
  const [background, setBackground] = useState<string>(DEFAULT_BACKGROUND);

  useFrontendTool({
    name: "change_background",
    description:
      "Change the page background. Accepts any valid CSS background value — colors, linear or radial gradients, etc.",
    parameters: z.object({
      background: z
        .string()
        .describe("The CSS background value. Prefer gradients."),
    }),
    handler: async ({ background }) => {
      setBackground(background);
      return { status: "success" };
    },
  });
```

The handler receives the parsed, type-safe parameters and can do anything
the browser can: update state, call an API, touch the DOM. Its return value
is sent back to the agent as the tool result so the model can reason about
what happened.

```typescript
// src/app/demos/frontend-tools/page.tsx
    handler: async ({ background }) => {
      setBackground(background);
      return { status: "success" };
    },
```
