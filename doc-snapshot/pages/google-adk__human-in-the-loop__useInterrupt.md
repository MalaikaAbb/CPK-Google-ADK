# Pausing the Agent for Input

> Pause an agent run mid-tool, hand control to a custom React component, and resume with the user's answer.


<!-- interactive demo: gen-ui-interrupt -->


## What is this?

`useInterrupt` lets your agent pause mid-run, hand control to the user
through a custom React component, and resume with whatever the user
returns. How that pause is implemented depends on the framework's
runtime.







> **Not available on this framework.** `useInterrupt` is only meaningful
> when the underlying runtime exposes either a native `interrupt(...)`
> primitive (LangGraph, AWS Strands) or a Promise-resolving frontend tool
> path. For
> all other integrations, use
> [`useHumanInTheLoop`](../human-in-the-loop) instead — it's the
> standard hook for tool-call-based pause/resume flows and works on
> every framework that supports tool calls.



## When should I use this?

Reach for `useInterrupt` when the pause is a **graph-enforced
checkpoint** where the code path _must_ stop and wait for a human,
not an LLM-initiated tool call. Typical cases:

- A sensitive action (payments, irreversible writes) must be approved
- A required piece of state isn't known and can only be collected from the user
- The agent explicitly reaches an approval node in a longer workflow
- You want the server-side contract to be `interrupt(...)` and resume with a payload

For LLM-initiated pauses where the model decides on the fly to ask
the user, prefer [`useHumanInTheLoop`](../human-in-the-loop).







## AG-UI standard interrupt flow vs. legacy

`useInterrupt` supports two interrupt transports. Understanding which one your
agent uses helps you write the right `render` code.

### Standard flow (`RUN_FINISHED` with `outcome.type === "interrupt"`)

When the agent backend conforms to the AG-UI protocol, it signals an interrupt
by emitting a `RUN_FINISHED` event whose outcome carries the interrupts array:

```
outcome.type === "interrupt"
outcome.interrupts  // Interrupt[]
```

The hook detects this on `onRunFinishedEvent` and exposes the interrupts on the
render props **after** `onRunFinalized` fires. Your `render` function receives:

- **`interrupt`** — the primary `Interrupt` (`interrupts[0]`), with shape
  `{ id, reason, message?, toolCallId?, responseSchema?, expiresAt?, metadata? }`.
- **`interrupts`** — the full open set (usually one, but multi-interrupt is
  supported — see below).
- **`resolve(payload?, interruptId?)`** — records `{ status: "resolved", payload }`
  for the targeted interrupt (defaults to the primary). The agent run resumes
  once every open interrupt has a response.
- **`cancel(interruptId?)`** — records `{ status: "cancelled" }` for the
  targeted interrupt. Same accumulate-then-submit logic applies.

### Legacy flow (`on_interrupt` custom event)

Older agents (or agents not yet migrated to the AG-UI interrupt spec) emit a
custom `on_interrupt` event. The hook detects this on `onCustomEvent` and sets
`interrupt` to `null` and `interrupts` to `[]`. The payload is in
`event.value`. Calling `resolve(payload)` resumes via `forwardedProps.command`
(the legacy resume mechanism). `cancel()` dismisses the interrupt without
resuming — the agent never receives a response.

### Priority

If both signals appear on the same run (unlikely but possible during migration),
the standard flow wins.

### Approve / Cancel example

```tsx
function ApprovalInterrupt() {
  useInterrupt({
    render: ({ interrupt, resolve, cancel }) => (
      <div className="p-3 border rounded">
        <p>{interrupt?.message ?? "Approve this action?"}</p>
        <div className="mt-2 flex gap-2">
          <button onClick={() => resolve({ approved: true })}>Approve</button>
          <button onClick={() => cancel()}>Cancel</button>
        </div>
      </div>
    ),
  });
  return null;
}
```

`resolve({ approved: true })` records a resolved entry and submits the `resume`
array to the agent. `cancel()` records a cancelled entry and does the same.
Both return the `RunAgentResult` once the run restarts.

### Multi-interrupt behavior

Some agents issue more than one interrupt in a single run (e.g. two independent
approvals). Each interrupt has its own `id`. Address them individually:

```tsx
useInterrupt({
  render: ({ interrupts, resolve, cancel }) => (
    <ul>
      {interrupts.map((i) => (
        <li key={i.id}>
          {i.message}
          <button onClick={() => resolve({ ok: true }, i.id)}>Approve</button>
          <button onClick={() => cancel(i.id)}>Cancel</button>
        </li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  ),
});
```

The agent run only resumes once **every** open interrupt has been addressed.
Calling `resolve` or `cancel` with a specific `interruptId` marks that interrupt
done; the hook auto-submits the accumulated responses when the last one is
addressed. If you omit `interruptId`, the primary interrupt (`interrupts[0]`)
is targeted.

### `responseSchema` — surface only, no client-side validation

The `Interrupt` type exposes a `responseSchema` field (a JSON Schema object)
that the agent can use to describe the expected payload shape. `useInterrupt`
surfaces this field on `interrupt.responseSchema` for your UI to read
(e.g. to drive a form), but it does **not** validate `resolve` payloads against
it. Validation is the agent's responsibility on resume.

## Going further

- [Tool-based HITL with `useHumanInTheLoop`](../human-in-the-loop) — for
  LLM-initiated pauses.
- [Headless interrupts](./headless) — compose the lower-level primitives
  (`useAgent`, `agent.subscribe`, `copilotkit.runAgent`) to resolve
  interrupts outside a chat surface.
